// Psuosto code

// a game with 4 crystals and a random computer generated number.
// 
//Every crystal needs to have a random number between 1 and 12
// Computer generated number will be between 19 and 120
//A new random number should be generated for each crystal 
//and computer total after every win and loss

//Each time a crystal is clicked - its value is added to the total
//UNITL the total equals to or is greater then the computers number.


// if total of crystal value is less then computer number - continue pick another crystal
// if total of crystal value is equal to the computer number -Win
// if total of  crystal value is greater than the computer number - Loss
